Chinese : 中国地质大学 ; traditional Chinese : 中地|大W ; pinyin : Zhōngguó Dìzhì Dàxué ; colloquially 地大; is a key national university directly under the administration of the Education Ministry of the People's Republic of China . It consists of two campuses, one is located in Haidian District in Beijing , and the other in Wuhan , the capital of Central China's Hubei Province .

History [ edit ]  The history of China University of Geosciences dates back to Beijing Institute of Geology BIG simplified Chinese : 北京地质学院 ; traditional Chinese : 北京地|W院 ; pinyin : Běijīng Dìzhì Xuéyuàn which was a merger of the geology departments of Tsinghua University , Peking University , Tianjin University and Tangshan Railway College . It was among China's first 16 key universities back in the 1950s. The university suspended operations from 1966-1970 due to the Cultural Revolution , and reopened in Jiangling County , Hubei Province, in 1970 as Hubei Institute of Geology simplified Chinese : 湖北地质学院 ; traditional Chinese : 湖北地|W院 ; pinyin : Húběi Dìzhì Xuéyuàn . [ 3 ]  In 1975 the campus was moved to Wuhan , and the school was renamed Wuhan Institute of Geology WIG simplified Chinese : 武汉地质学院 ; traditional Chinese : 武h地|W院 ; pinyin : Wǔhàn Dìzhì Xuéyuàn . In 1978 BIG reopened in Beijing with the help of Deng Xiaoping . In 1986 the Chinese Government ratified the foundation of the Graduate School of WIG. It was ranked as one of the first 33 Graduate Schools nationwide. Later in 1987 BIG and WIG were renamed China University of Geosciences （Beijing） and China University of Geosciences （Wuhan） , respectively. CUG is among the first batch of 15 universities in project 211 for Higher Education .
