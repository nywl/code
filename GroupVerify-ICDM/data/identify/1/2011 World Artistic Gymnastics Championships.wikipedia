Alicia Sacramone injured her Achilles tendon during the last Podium training and had already left Japan when the Team Final started. However, US National Team Coordinator Marta Karolyi opted to keep her on the roster instead of officially naming alternate Anna Li to the team and subsequently competed with only 5 instead of the usual 6 gymnasts. This led to Alicia Sacramone receiving her tenth World Championships medal and officially becoming the US gymnast with the most World Championship medals. As Sacramone was not present during the competition Anna Li dressed, supported the team on the floor, and accepted the team medal for Alicia. Anna Li later passed the medal on to Sacramone and received as costumary for the World team alternates a copy from USAG.   Individual all-around [ edit ]  The final was held on October 13. None of the medallists from the previous year were able to compete to defend their title as the Gold and Bronze medallists - Aliya Mustafina and Rebecca Bross - were both unable to compete at worlds due to knee injuries and Silver medallist, Jiang did not qualify high enough over teammates. A number of gymnasts ranked high enough to make the all-around final, but did not qualify due to the 2-per-country rule. All the gymnasts from the USA that competed in the preliminary round had ranked in the top 24. The gymnasts affected were Gabby Douglas 5th , Sabrina Vega 9th , and McKayla Maroney 12th of the United States. Also affected were Tan Sixin 15th and Yuyuan Jiang 20th of China, Yuko Shintake 21st and Yu Minobe 23rd of Japan, and Anna Dementyeva 31st of Russia. In the end the last gymnast to qualify was Carlotta Ferlito who had ranked 32nd in the prelimary competition.

Marian Dragulescu had qualified in 2nd, [ 10 ] but pulled out of the competition on the morning of the final. As the first reserve, Jake Dalton USA took his place. There was also an inquiry made by the Japanese coaches into the scoring when Kōhei Uchimura's difficulty score was only awarded a 6.500 because they had mistaken a triple twisting move for a double twisting move. The inquiry was accepted by the judges, and the score adjusted accordingly, which gave Uchimura the gold medal.
