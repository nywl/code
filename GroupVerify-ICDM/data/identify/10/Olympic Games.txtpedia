The Games are currently held every two years, with Summer and Winter Olympic Games alternating, although they occur every four years within their respective seasonal games. Originally, the ancient Olympic Games were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894.

The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating, meaning they each occur every four years but two years apart. Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, which were held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee in 1894. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, with the Olympic Charter defining its structure and authority.\nThe evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in several changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Games for ice and winter sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with a disability, and the Youth Olympic Games for teenage athletes. The IOC has had to adapt to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to allow participation of professional athletes. The growing importance of mass media created the issue of corporate sponsorship and commercialization of the Games. World wars led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Games. Large boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Games. ,creator : /user/wikirecon_bot ,project : wikirecon ,dataset : /m/0kj4zz_ ,citation : {provider : Wikipedia ,statement : Description licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License). ,uri : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games}}],count : 41.0},/common/topic/notable_for : {valuetype : object ,values : [{text : Website Category ,lang : en ,id : /internet/website_category}],count : 1.0},/common/topic/notable_types : {valuetype : object ,values : [{text : Website Category ,lang : en ,id : /internet/website_category}],count : 1.0},/common/topic/official_website : {valuetype : uri ,values : [{text : http://www.olympic.org/ ,lang : ,value : http://www.olympic.org/ ,creator : /user/kittzy07 ,timestamp : 2013-06-22T06:40:40.000Z}],count : 1.0},/common/topic/social_media_presence : {valuetype : uri ,values : [{text : http://plus.google.com/109192583663551892471 ,lang : ,value : http://plus.google.com/109192583663551892471 ,creator : /user/googlebot ,timestamp : 2012-11-14T18:42:48.000Z}],count : 1.0},/common/topic/topic_equivalent_webpage : {valuetype : uri ,values : [{text : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=22576 ,lang : ,value : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=22576 ,creator : /user/metaweb ,timestamp : 2006-10-22T09:16:14.003Z},{text : http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=1624 ,lang : ,value : http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/index.html?curid=1624 ,creator : /user/wikipedia_intl ,timestamp : 2010-09-24T07:35:50.000Z},{text : http://pt
