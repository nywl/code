[ 1 ]  Dr. Magnanti is Institute Professor and former Dean of the School of Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . He has served on thesis committees for approximately 70 doctoral students, supervising over 25. He is slated to be the president of Singapore's fourth university, Singapore University of Technology and Design when it opens in 2011. [ 2 ]  Magnanti has been Editor-in-Chief of the journal Operations Research . [ 3 ]  Magnanti is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . He was a founding co-director of MIT's Leaders for Manufacturing Program now the Leaders for Global Operations program and the System Design and Management MIT program. [ 4 ] He is a past President of the Operations Research Society of America ORSA and of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences INFORMS . [ 5 ]  He has received honorary doctorates from Link?ping University , the Universit¨¦ de Montr¨¦al , and the Universit¨¦ Catholique de Louvain . He has also won the MIT Billard Award and ORSA George E. Kimball Medal for distinguished service. [ 6 ]  Work [ edit ]  Magnanti's teaching and research interests are in applied and theoretical aspects of large-scale optimization and operations research , specifically on the theory and application of large-scale optimization, particularly in the areas of network flows , nonlinear programming , and combinatorial optimization . He has conducted research on such topics as production planning and scheduling, transportation planning, facility location, logistics, and communication systems design. He is also known for pioneering an educational philosophy that combines engineering and management.
